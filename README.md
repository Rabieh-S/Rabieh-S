<h1>Hi there, I'm Rabieh ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
I'm a passionate developer who loves to learn new things and solve challenging problems. My journey in the tech industry started in 2021. Since then, I have been exploring different areas of development and constantly expanding my skillset.

<h2>Goals</h2>
My ultimate goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer in Javascript with a bit of DevOps best practices and skills. I'm looking forward to working on exciting projects that challenge me and allow me to showcase my skills. I'm also open to collaborating with other developers and learning from their experiences.

<h2>Why Full-stack JS?</h2>
As I delved deeper into the world of development, I found my passion for full-stack development with a focus on JavaScript. I'm excited about its versatility and the endless possibilities it offers for creating rich, interactive, and scalable web applications. I enjoy working with different libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Node.js, to build elegant and robust solutions.

<h2>DevOps Learning</h2>
In addition to my full-stack JS journey, I'm also interested in DevOps. I believe it's essential to have a good understanding of DevOps to build and deploy applications that are reliable, efficient, and secure. I'm currently learning about different DevOps tools and methodologies, such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and Jenkins, to name a few.

Thanks for stopping by!
